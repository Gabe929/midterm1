The goal of our program is to predict the rating of any app using the category it is based on and the use of the app in that category. 
In order to accomplish this, we defined classes Apps and RankingApp and made header files for both classes. 
The Apps class takes the name and rating of the app, the category it comes from, and the number of downloads and returns the info for the RankingApp class. 
The RankingApp class then uses this info to see if the app is in the top 500 ranking of the Google Play Store and returns the ranking number.

Gabriel made the outline for the project and worked on most of the code and Oscar worked on the code and the pseudocode for the project.
