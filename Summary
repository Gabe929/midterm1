The goal of our program is to predict the rating of any app using the category it is based on and the use of the app in that category. 
In order to accomplish this, we defined classes Apps and RankingApp and made header files for both classes. 
The Apps class takes the name and rating of the app, the category it comes from, and the number of downloads and returns the info for the RankingApp class. 
The RankingApp class then uses this info to see if the app is in the top 500 ranking of the Google Play Store and returns the ranking number. It does this 
by the reading the text file that has a list of the top 500 as of November 2, 2020. We assign the value on the list to variables and check if it mathces with the user 
input it it does not it continues to go down the list until it finally all matches in which it sets the value of the apps rank. Afterwards we print it out for the user.

Gabriel implemented most of the code which include the the main class, the apps classes, rankingapps classes and the mytext.txt file. 
Oscar made the outline for the project and came up with the format of the program, helped with debugging the code and wrote all the pseudocode for the project.
Issac documented and summarized the coding for the written portion.
